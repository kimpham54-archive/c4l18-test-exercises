Introduction to Markdown


Exercises
Name your files as *.md or set markup=”markdown” in front matter


- Markdown is a relatively new syntax. Developed in 2004 by John Gruber, Markdown refers to both (1) a way of formatting text files, as well as (2) a Perl utility to convert Markdown files into HTML.

- Plain text files have many advantages over other formats. For one, they are readable on virtually all devices, easy to understand and durable
- By following Markdown syntax, you’ll be able to produce files that are both legible in plain text and ready to be styled on other platforms. Many blogging engines, static site generators, and sites like GitHub also support Markdown, and will render these files into HTML for display on the web. Additionally, tools like Pandoc can convert files into and out of Markdown.
- Markdown files are saved with the extension .md, and can be opened in a text editor such as TextEdit, Notepad, Sublime Text, or Vim.


- Many websites and publishing platforms also offer web-based editors and/or extensions for entering text using Markdown syntax.


- In this tutorial, we’ll be practicing Markdown syntax in the browser using Dillinger. You’ll be able to enter Markdown-formatted text on the left and immediately see the rendered version alongside it on the right.

- open existing markdown file from github

You’ll notice that while the right panel features a more elegant rendering of the text, the original Markdown file on the left is still fairly readable.

Now, let’s dive into the lesson by writing our own Markdown syntax. Create a new document in StackEdit by clicking the folder icon in the upper right and choosing New document. You may enter a title for the document in the textbox on the top of the page.
